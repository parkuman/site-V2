I’m Parker, an engineer and software developer in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering specialized in Entreprenuership & Innovation @ Queen’s University.

Ever since I was young I’ve loved to learn about technology and how I can build new things with it. I create things that people use and enjoy, including: apps, websites, gadgets and computers. Check out [PROWE PCs](https://pc.prowe.ca/) - my side gig for building and repairing PCs!

Outside class I’m a leader in multiple teams which teach and spread interest in tech and engineering.

Aside from tech, I love camping 🏕, playing guitar 🎸 and spending time with friends.
