description: "As AI team lead of of Queens University's Robomaster Design Team, I've lead twenty students toward learning, designing and creating auto-targeting robot artificial intelligence. Using Tensorflow's Object Detection API we have created a detection algorithm to detect enemy robot hit plates. Automating this process has given us a considerable advantage against the competition, and we learned a ton in the process! We found that the way we labelled data, and differentiating between red & blue coloured plates had a considerable effect on how accurate our model was. And we still have more work to do!"
